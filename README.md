About the Case Study 

#The new ZoomZoom Bat Scooter is now available for purchase exclusively on its website. Initially, sales were strong, but after a couple of weeks, pre-orders unexpectedly dropped by 20%. As ZoomZoom's top data analyst, it's your job to uncover the reason behind this decline.

#In this case study, we will apply the scientific method to investigate the decline in Bat Scooter sales. At its core, this process involves testing hypotheses using objectively gathered data. We can break it down into the following key steps:
1.Define the problem – Identify the cause behind the 20% drop in Bat Scooter sales after approximately two weeks.
2.Conduct background research – Gather relevant data and insights to develop an initial hypothesis for the decline.
3.Formulate a hypothesis – Propose a possible explanation for the drop in sales.
4.Design and execute an experiment – Test the hypothesis under controlled conditions, ensuring that all variables remain constant except the one being investigated.
5.Analyze the data – Examine the results obtained from the experiment to identify patterns or correlations.
6.Report findings – Present the analysis and conclusions to explain the reason behind the sales decline.
