About the Case Study 

#The new ZoomZoom Bat Scooter is now available for purchase exclusively on its website. Initially, sales were strong, but after a couple of weeks, pre-orders unexpectedly dropped by 20%. As ZoomZoom's top data analyst, it's your job to uncover the reason behind this decline.

#In this case study, we will apply the scientific method to investigate the decline in Bat Scooter sales. At its core, this process involves testing hypotheses using objectively gathered data. We can break it down into the following key steps:
1.Define the problem – Identify the cause behind the 20% drop in Bat Scooter sales after approximately two weeks.
2.Conduct background research – Gather relevant data and insights to develop an initial hypothesis for the decline.
3.Formulate a hypothesis – Propose a possible explanation for the drop in sales.
4.Design and execute an experiment – Test the hypothesis under controlled conditions, ensuring that all variables remain constant except the one being investigated.
5.Analyze the data – Examine the results obtained from the experiment to identify patterns or correlations.
6.Report findings – Present the analysis and conclusions to explain the reason behind the sales decline.

Key Findings

Launch Timing Impact: Evidence suggests that launch timing could be related to the drop in sales after two weeks, though causality cannot be confirmed.

Sales Price Correlation: Initial sales rates showed a correlation with price reductions—lower prices led to higher sales in the short term. However, overall sales in the first three weeks were not directly correlated to the sales price.

Marketing Influence: Increased email opening rates and a higher number of marketing emails sent correlated with improved initial sales performance.

Comparative Product Performance: The Bat Scooter outperformed the Lemon and Bat Limited scooters in unit sales during the first three weeks.

Recommendations for Further Testing

To confirm these findings, in-field testing (such as A/B testing) is required. Suggested experiments include:

Launching future scooter products at different times in similar markets to assess the impact of launch timing.

Testing different pricing strategies in equivalent regions to observe sales variations.

Running distinct email marketing campaigns in comparable regions to measure effectiveness.

These tests will provide actionable insights to optimize future product launches and marketing strategies.
